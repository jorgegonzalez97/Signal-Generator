# Signal-Generator

Generation of RF radar signals:

signals - Linear frequency modulation (lfm) , stepped lfm, triangle lfm, stepped triangle lfm, m- amplitude shift keying, m - frequency shift keying, m - phase shift keying,
          m - quadrature amplitude modulation, non linear lfm.
          
codes -   Barker, Costas, Frank, Huffman, P1-P4, Pnk, Px, T1-T4, Zadoff-Chu


Generation of signals in time-series format and as TFI (STFT, Wigner Ville Distribution and Choi Williams Distributions)
